<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>There isn't much a person can say about yourself other than the fact that you are an individual with certain capabilities in which you strive towards your accomplishments. That is why I see myself as someone who's in search of discovering his truest potential in life. One such potential is the art in mastering coding and being able to use every possible endeavour towards the success it can bring in my, as well as others' lives.</p>
<p>I like to spend my time with some light reading of fantasy novels, practicing the piano and play games casually. I do like to spend time with fellow family and friends as well as my pets. I am someone open to many adventerous activities as long as its' within reason and not unjust towards my morals or others'.</p>
<p>I am currently in my early tweens and am currently employed as a professional camo grinder in the popular game: Call of Duty, for the company called GRIND. I have spent a total of 2 years and 6 months as an employee in the company. </p>
